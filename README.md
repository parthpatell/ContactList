# ContactList

This is an app used to demonstrate SQLite database, Listview, Custom Array Adapter, and Fragments.

##What I learnt:

### Fragments

How to implement fragments when an onClickListener or a button is pressed. 
Fragments are different from Activity because we dont have to create a new activity page but rather it takes us to a new static page
with information.

### Listview

A simple list view can be created using XML file but to get an array input into the listview we need to create a array adapter that
takes the value of the array ID and arranges it in a list view. 

### SQLite database

Used this to store the array for the contacts in the list and their relations. I was having trouble implementing and calling the array.
